# Notes for this
Need to have the following mods:
 - Advanced Macros
 - Active Token Lighting
 - Dynamic Active Effects
 - Item Macros
 - Midi qol (i think)

The Starry Form - Dragon, currently doesn't work properly as i have no idea how to override the rolls so all it does is glow, and add 9 to any roll for concentration saving throwsto avoid accidental spell cancelling
