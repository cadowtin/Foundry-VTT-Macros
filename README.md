# Foundry-VTT-Macros & Items
Basically a place for me to sort out the macros I use. Most of them are borrowed and adapted and I claim credit for barely any of this code. I'll give credit as I go through hopefully.

For instructions on how to run macros etc. check out [Crymic's Guide](https://gitlab.com/crymic/foundry-vtt-macros/-/blob/8.x/README.md)
